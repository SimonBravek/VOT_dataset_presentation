# VOT_dataset_presentation_3
This is the third version of VOT web 2023 and future dataset presentation creation guide. I'll try to summorize what me and Tomas Peterka did on this project and handle it over to the MatÄ›j Marek. Hopefully finished...


*the majority of the site is borrowed from the original VOT site. I assume that they don't work without their JS files, but when merged with the parent
website, the anchors should work

**the site stucture:

main.html  -  listStyles.css
           -  sequenceRow.css
           -  inputUpdateNeeded.js
           -  actionManagment.js
           -  previewDevelopment.js  
           -  navigationList.js
